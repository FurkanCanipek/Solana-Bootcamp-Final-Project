# Solana-Bootcamp-Final-Project
Final project for solana bootcamp.
To initialize and deploy this project. first create a new yaml file, preferably named tree.yaml. Then fill the contents of the file with tree.yaml file. afterwards go to the directory where the yaml file is and run the command "codigo solana generate <yaml file name>". Then fill in each of .rs files corresponding to the .rs files included here namely: mint.rs, burn.rs, transfer.rs, advance_age.rs, reverse_age.rs and reset_age.rs. After you fill in the files navigate to the directory where the cargo.toml file is then run the command "cargo build-sbf" to build the contract. Then run the command "solana config set --url devnet" to connect to devnet. Type "solana balance" to check your solana balance if you have enough run "solana program deploy target/deploy/nft.so" to deploy the contract if you don't have enough then run "solana airdrop 1" befor deploying the contract. Afterwards you'll get a program id as output, take note of this program id we'll need it later. Afterwards navigate to your program_client directory and run the commands "yarn install" and "yarn add @solana/spl-token" then create an app.ts file then fill it with the contents of the app.ts file included here. Then run the command "npx ts-node app.ts <YOUR_PROGRAM_ID>" to test the smart contract, you need the porgram id generated on the last part to run this command.
